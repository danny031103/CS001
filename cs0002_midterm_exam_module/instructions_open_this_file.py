import cs0002_midterm_exam_module

# the midterm exam module contains a series of functions that will be used to solve
# questions on both the practice quiz and the actual exam

# during the exam you can use this file to write your programs, or you can create
# new files in the same folder as this file.

# the important thing to note is that all of your programs MUST be in the same folder
# as the 'cs0002_midterm_exam_module.py' file so that the 'import' statement above
# will work as expected

# to test your system we will go ahead and call the 'hello_world' function inside of
# the 'cs0002_midterm_exam_module' to make sure that your computer is set up correctly
cs0002_midterm_exam_module.hello_world()

# if this function runs as expected and you see some output you are ready to go!
